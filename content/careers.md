        ### Objectivity
        Data-driven decision making is integral to the platform we provide our clients. We carry this into our day to day and strategic decision making process.
        
        It is important to us that as a company we are making decisions that are informed by data.

        ### Autonomy
        We are a remote-first company. It is implicit that our people are provided with lots of autonomy.
        
        We are singularly focused on output...not clock-watching. Flexibility is a definite perk of working at Bramble.

        ### Accountability
        The flip-side of autonomy!
        
        Bramble is in rapid growth stage so it’s important that we get stuff done quickly with the best possible quality.
        
        However we know mistakes will happen. We encourage people to fail forward...it’s important to not shy away from mistakes as long as we are constantly learning from them.
