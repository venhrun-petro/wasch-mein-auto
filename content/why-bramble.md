  sub_title: Advanced metrics
  paragraph: 'Organizations are missing an opportunity to better leverage data-points
    from their tech-stack to build upon traditional operational metrics, and to use
    data to efficiently diagnose the root-cause behind outcomes. At Bramble, we augment
    your operational perspective with real-time team and individual metrics which
    provide a holistic view of performance. Bramble advanced metrics are used to assist
    with: performance management, forecasting and resource planning, targeted training
    plans and continious improvement initiatives.'

  sub_title: The bramble caDence
  paragraph: It is extremely challenging for leaders to be proactive without timely
    performance reporting and operational information. We often see leaders are lacking
    the tools required to shift from a rear-vision view of their world, to forward-planning
    with intent. Without the right reporting and feedback loops in place, leaders
    tend to continually ‘do things the way they’ve always been done.’ The Bramble
    Cadence provides a framework for your staff and leaders to convert data-driven
    insight into proactive decisions, which ultimately allows them to be more effective
    in their role.

  sub_title: motivate and engage
  paragraph: |-
    We know that staff engagement is largely driven by: 1. A focus on individual professional development 2. Strong and consistent team 3. Recognition of performance.
    Additionally, as more companies shift towards a ‘remote-first’ environment, more emphasis must be placed on the informal network that makes work enjoyable for the majority of people.
    Bramble provides the ability to routinely assess your people’s engagement, and provides the transparency and behaviors required to impact the drivers of their engagement.

  sub_title: continious improvement
  paragraph: |-
    Often we see that as companies grow or change over time, it leads to a heightened segregation of duties or staff siloing by function, which in-turn results in increased latent capacity across the organization.
    At a team level, the Bramble forecasting and planning modules highlight to your leaders and staff exactly where that latent capacity exists, allowing for it to be proactively re-directed into value-adding initiatives for the organization. This approach has the added benefit of empowering your frontline to be part of the solution.
    At an Enterprise level, the Continious Improvement reporting suite allows Executives to size the impact of People, Process and System initatives, with the click of  a mouse. To close that loop, Bramble provides on-going tracking of time invested and benefit derived once a transformation project is underway.
